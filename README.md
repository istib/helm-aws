## Helm AWS

Manage EC2 instances simply straight from Emacs. Choose from
active instances on your AWS account and perform actions on them in a
blast (e.g. start/stop instance, launch ssh session within emacs, start dired, ping etc.).

Requires [helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) and [AWS cli](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
